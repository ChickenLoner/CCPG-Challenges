# 🎯 CCPG-Challenges

Official challenge repository for [CyberChef Playground](https://github.com/ChickenLoner/CyberChef-Playground) — a CTF-style platform for learning cryptography and reverse engineering with CyberChef.

Challenges are stored here separately from the app to keep the main repo safe from GitHub scanning CTF binaries and malware samples. Inspired by [KAPE's KapeFiles](https://github.com/EricZimmerman/KapeFiles) model.

<!-- CHALLENGES_START -->
## 📋 Challenges (11 total)

| # | Name | Slug | Description | Downloads |
|---|------|------|-------------|-----------|
| 1 | **XOR Warmup** | `xor-warmup` | A simple XOR encryption. Reverse the binary to find the key. | 1 file |
| 2 | **Base64 Layering** | `base64-layering` | Multiple encoding layers. What's hiding beneath? | 1 file |
| 3 | **Substitution Mystery** | `substitution-mystery` | Simple substitution cipher. Can you extract the key and get our file back? | 1 file |
| 4 | **ROTTWEILER** | `rottweiler` | Classical cipher | 1 file |
| 5 | **Multi-stage ransomware** | `multi-stage-ransomware` | Ransomware-like encryption chain. Decrypt all stages to win! | 1 file |
| 6 | **Simply Beacon** | `simply-beacon` | We detected lateral movement using Cobalt Stike in our environment, create a recipe to extract final payload of its dropper | 1 file |
| 7 | **Access Log 1** | `access-log-1` | A company's web server was recently compromised in what became a catastrophic breach. The incident response team has recovered the `access.log` from the web server and Suricata alerts have confirmed multiple attack types were directed at this server. | 1 file |
| 8 | **Access Log 2** | `access-log-2` | The same company's web server from the previous challenge is under investigation. Suricata alerts have flagged suspicious authentication activity targeting the login endpoint. The incident response team suspects one or more threat actors conducted a credential bruteforce attack against the web application. | 1 file |
| 9 | **Access Log 3** | `access-log-3` | Following the LFI and bruteforce attacks identified in previous challenges, the incident response team believes the threat actor successfully uploaded a webshell to the compromised web server. Suricata has flagged outbound connections to a known C2 address, suggesting the attacker used the webshell to execute system commands and establish persistence. | 1 file |
| 10 | **SSH Brute Force 1** | `ssh-log-1` | Following the web application attack, the threat actor discovered SSH port opened on the web server, find out what happened before the breach occured! | 1 file |
| 11 | **SSH Brute Force 2** | `ssh-log-2` | After Identified an IP address used to target SSH port running on web server, find out how many unique usernames were used in this attack | 1 file |

## 📁 Repository Structure

```
CCPG-Challenges/
├── challenges/
│   ├── xor-warmup/               ← folder slug (meaningful name)
│   │   ├── challenge.json        ← metadata: id, name, hint, flag, files
│   │   ├── solution.json         ← CyberChef recipe (server-side only)
│   │   ├── xor_challenge.zip     ← download package for players
│   │   └── validation.bin        ← server-only validation file (never shared)
│   ├── base64-layering/
│   └── ...
├── scripts/
│   └── generate-readme.js        ← auto-generates the challenge table above
└── .github/workflows/
    └── update-readme.yml         ← runs generate-readme.js on every push
```

**Key rules:**
- Folder name = slug (lowercase, hyphens) — can be anything descriptive
- `id` in `challenge.json` controls the progression order, not the folder name
- `solution.json` and `validation.bin` are server-side only — never include them in player downloads

## 🔄 Syncing Challenges (Players & Operators)

Challenges are pulled into CyberChef Playground with one command:

```bash
# In your CyberChef-Playground directory:
npm run sync
```

- **First run** — clones this repo into `.ccpg-challenges/`
- **Subsequent runs** — `git pull` to fetch new or updated challenges
- **Docker** — challenges are cloned automatically during `docker-compose up --build`

---

## 🔒 Security Notice

**For Educational Purposes Only**

Challenges may contain:
- Simulated encryption programs (not real malware)
- Sample binary files for reverse engineering practice
- PCAP files with encrypted traffic (safe, synthetic data)
- Blue team training scenarios

All content is designed for learning cryptography, reverse engineering, and defensive security skills.

## 🤝 Contributing

Want to add a challenge? See the full guide in the main repo:
👉 [CTF_AUTHOR_GUIDE.md](https://github.com/ChickenLoner/CyberChef-Playground/blob/main/CTF_AUTHOR_GUIDE.md)

**Quick steps:**
1. Fork this repo
2. Create `challenges/<your-slug>/` with `challenge.json`, `solution.json`, and your files
3. Set `id` to the next available number in `challenge.json`
4. Test with `npm run sync && npm start` from CyberChef-Playground
5. Open a pull request

The challenge table in this README is **automatically updated** by GitHub Actions whenever `challenge.json` files change — no manual edits needed.
