# 🎯 CCPG-Challenges

Official challenge repository for [CyberChef Playground](https://github.com/ChickenLoner/CyberChef-Playground) — a CTF-style platform for learning cryptography and reverse engineering with CyberChef.

Challenges are stored here separately from the app to keep the main repo safe from GitHub scanning CTF binaries and malware samples. Inspired by [KAPE's KapeFiles](https://github.com/EricZimmerman/KapeFiles) model.

<!-- CHALLENGES_START -->
## 📋 Challenges (5 total)

| # | Name | Slug | Description | Downloads |
|---|------|------|-------------|-----------|
| 1 | **XOR Warmup** | `xor-warmup` | A simple XOR encryption. Reverse the binary to find the key. | 1 file |
| 2 | **Base64 Layering** | `base64-layering` | Multiple encoding layers. What's hiding beneath? | 1 file |
| 3 | **Substitution Mystery** | `substitution-mystery` | Simple substitution cipher. Can you extract the key? | 3 files |
| 4 | **ROTTWEILER** | `rottweiler` | Classical cipher | 1 file |
| 5 | **Multi-stage ransomware** | `multi-stage-ransomware` | Ransomware-like encryption chain. Decrypt all stages to win! | 1 file |

## 📁 Repository Structure

```
CCPG-Challenges/
├── challenges/
│   ├── xor-warmup/               ← folder slug (meaningful name)
│   │   ├── challenge.json        ← metadata: id, name, hint, flag, files
│   │   ├── solution.json         ← CyberChef recipe (server-side only)
│   │   ├── xor_challenge.zip     ← download package for players
│   │   └── validation.bin        ← server-only validation file (never shared)
│   ├── base64-layering/
│   └── ...
├── scripts/
│   └── generate-readme.js        ← auto-generates the challenge table above
└── .github/workflows/
    └── update-readme.yml         ← runs generate-readme.js on every push
```

**Key rules:**
- Folder name = slug (lowercase, hyphens) — can be anything descriptive
- `id` in `challenge.json` controls the progression order, not the folder name
- `solution.json` and `validation.bin` are server-side only — never include them in player downloads

## 🔄 Syncing Challenges (Players & Operators)

Challenges are pulled into CyberChef Playground with one command:

```bash
# In your CyberChef-Playground directory:
npm run sync
```

- **First run** — clones this repo into `.ccpg-challenges/`
- **Subsequent runs** — `git pull` to fetch new or updated challenges
- **Docker** — challenges are cloned automatically during `docker-compose up --build`

---

## 🔒 Security Notice

**For Educational Purposes Only**

Challenges may contain:
- Simulated encryption programs (not real malware)
- Sample binary files for reverse engineering practice
- PCAP files with encrypted traffic (safe, synthetic data)
- Blue team training scenarios

All content is designed for learning cryptography, reverse engineering, and defensive security skills.

## 🤝 Contributing

Want to add a challenge? See the full guide in the main repo:
👉 [CTF_AUTHOR_GUIDE.md](https://github.com/ChickenLoner/CyberChef-Playground/blob/main/CTF_AUTHOR_GUIDE.md)

**Quick steps:**
1. Fork this repo
2. Create `challenges/<your-slug>/` with `challenge.json`, `solution.json`, and your files
3. Set `id` to the next available number in `challenge.json`
4. Test with `npm run sync && npm start` from CyberChef-Playground
5. Open a pull request

The challenge table in this README is **automatically updated** by GitHub Actions whenever `challenge.json` files change — no manual edits needed.
