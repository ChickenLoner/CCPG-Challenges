# Secure Shell 2 — Catch the payload!

## Scenario

After Identified an IP address used to target SSH port running on web server, find out how many unique usernames were used in this attack.

Your task focuses on the **auth.log** only.

## Objective

Extract all **unique usernames** used by the threat actor to conduct SSH bruteforce attack and sort alphabetically.

## Example

Given the following log entries:

```
Feb 28 20:36:57 brightmall-web01 sshd[29559]: Failed password for devops from 10.0.0.10 port 60693 ssh2
Feb 28 20:38:00 brightmall-web01 sshd[41063]: Failed password for jenkins from 172.16.1.100 port 59247 ssh2
Feb 28 20:40:26 brightmall-web01 sshd[21026]: Failed password for invalid user oracle from 185.156.73.54 port 57093 ssh2
Feb 28 20:40:35 brightmall-web01 sshd[39526]: Failed password for mysql from 185.156.73.54 port 57066 ssh2
Feb 28 20:40:38 brightmall-web01 sshd[54023]: Failed password for www-data from 185.156.73.54 port 62187 ssh2
Feb 28 20:40:48 brightmall-web01 sshd[13671]: Failed password for sysadmin from 185.156.73.54 port 64614 ssh2
Feb 28 20:40:57 brightmall-web01 sshd[52277]: Failed password for webadmin from 185.156.73.54 port 43826 ssh2
```

Your output should be:

```
mysql
oracle
sysadmin
webadmin
www-data
```

## Good luck!
