# Access Log 1 — Local File Inclusion

## Scenario

A company's web server was recently compromised in what became a catastrophic breach. The incident response team has recovered the `access.log` from the web server and Suricata alerts have confirmed multiple attack types were directed at this server.

Your task focuses on the **access.log** only.

## Objective

Extract all **unique payloads** utilized by the threat actor to exploit **Local File Inclusion (LFI) / Arbitrary File Read** on the web server, regardless of the IP address used to carry out the attack.

> **Note:** List each unique payload only once, in its raw form as it appears in the log (do not decode URL encoding).

## Expected Output

Given the following log entries:

```
127.0.0.1 - - [01/Jan/2026:11:00:11 +0500] "GET /view.php?doc=../../../etc/hosts HTTP/1.1" 200 1175 "-" "python-requests/2.31.0"
127.0.0.1 - - [01/Jan/2026:11:00:12 +0500] "GET /view.php?doc=../../../etc/shadow HTTP/1.1" 200 1200 "-" "python-requests/2.31.0"
10.0.0.5 - - [01/Jan/2026:11:00:15 +0500] "GET /view.php?doc=../../../etc/hosts HTTP/1.1" 200 1175 "-" "Mozilla/5.0"
```

Your output should be:

```
../../../etc/hosts
../../../etc/shadow
```

> Notice that `../../../etc/hosts` appears twice from two different IPs — it is only listed once in the answer.

## Good luck!
